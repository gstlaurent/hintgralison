DR. CLUE DOCUMENTATION
*******************************

Congratulations on your acquisition of the new Clue solving program, Dr. Clue!

Dr. Clue is a very user-friendly program. To start it, open prolog and type:

    [drclue]. <ENTER>

That loads up the program. To run it, type:

    clue. <ENTER>

That's it! It'll walk you through the rest. First you'll setup the game, telling
Dr. Clue things like what the rooms, weapons, and characters are, and who the
players are and what their order is. Once you're done that, it's ready to help
you play Clue! Just follow along with what it says, inputting information as
different players have their different turns. The more info you give it, the
better it will be at helping you Win at Clue! Eventually, when it knows enough,
it'll tell you to make an accusation. Do that as soon as you can and WIN THE
GAME! Congratulations again!

You can type things the way you always do: use capitals and lowercase, spaces,
punctuation -- you name it! Just hit <ENTER> when you're done typing, and Dr.
Clue will understand. But be careful: every time you type something, you have
to type it exactly the same way, so make sure you type it the way you want it
the first time. Don't worry though, if you happen to forget exactly how you
typed things, Dr. Clue will notice and it'll let you know what your options
really are. Sometimes Dr. Clue will even ask you preemptively if you want to
see everything it knows; then you can type

    db <ENTER>

and it'll print out its database contents. But it'll tell you all that when the
time comes, so for now, just rest easy and Clue away!



****************************************************
FEATURES OF DR. CLUE: WHAT DOES IT DO?
****************************************************

1.  Easy-to-use interface.
It prompts you throughout and offers you suggestions when it doesn't
understand what you tell it -- i.e., you made a typo -- or it recognizes your
input as otherwise invalid -- i.e., you might be lying to it. At the beginning
of each turn, you can easily ask Dr. Clue to display its database contents.

2.  Let's you input your suggestions.
When you tell Dr. Clue about a suggestion you made, along with the player and
card that you were shown (if any), then it will remember that that player has
that card. Additionally, it will infer some other information, which is
feature #3.

3.  Infers card disownership.
Any time Dr. Clue finds out that a player has a card -- either from your
suggestion, during the setup, or using inference as in #4 -- it realizes that
no one else can have that card, so it adds that info to its database. But it
also infers that players are lacking certain cards if, during a suggestion --
whether it's your or someone else's -- they had to give a pass without showing
anything.

4.  Infers card ownership.
Have you ever wondered what that card is that another player is showing to one
of your opponents when it isn't your turn? Well, now you can wonder less! If Dr.
Clue already has determined that a player doesn't have two of the cards in
a rival player's suggestion, but that player is showing a card anyway, then it
knows that that player MUST own the third card, so it adds it to the database.

5.  Provides Suggestion Suggestions.
Dr. Clue keeps track of cards which cards you've seen and which cards it has
deduced information about. When it is time to make a suggestion all you have
to do is tell Dr. Clue what room you are in, and it will provide you with
a recommended Suggestion for the weapon and character, taking from the list of
unknown cards when it can, and cards that it knows are in the envelope if there
aren't any unknowns for that type.

6.  Makes Accusations!
If Dr. Clue has learned enough to know for certain what the three cards are that
are in the envelope, then it let's you know! When you next have a chance (which
might be immediately), you can make an accusation and WIN THE GAME!
Congratulations, you! Congratulation, Dr. Clue!

7.  Customizable dealing order.
Sometimes the first player dealt to isn't the first player to have a turn. Dr.
Clue doesn't mind! When stating the names of the different players, Dr. Clue
will ask you how many cards each player has, and take it from there.

8.  Iterative envelope-content inferrences.
The moment that Dr. Clue realizes that everyone lacks a particular card, it
adds that to the list of cards that MUST BE in the envelope. You can see this
list during a database display.


****************************************************
FEATURES OF DR. CLUE: WHAT ARE ITS LIMITATIONS?
****************************************************

Well, there are lots of things that Dr. Clue doesn't do -- including making me
an omlette, regrettably -- but here are some of the more interesting ones:

1.  Handling unsportspersonlike users
Dr. Clue does not work if you LIE to it, or you CHEAT. In general, it's
smart enough to know when you've simply made a typo and let's you try again
(reminding you, as always, what the valid answers would be), but it will get
confused, for example, if you tell it that a rival player asked to see a card
that you have, but you are then too lazy to tell Dr. Clue that you actually
showed that card, telling it instead that you passed.

2.  Recovery from a mistake.
If you accidentally tell Dr. Clue the wrong thing -- such as that you were shown
Green when you were really shown White, or that Player 2 passed, when in fact,
Player 2 showed something -- then its database might be permanently confused.
Unfortunatley, the only way to get Dr. Clue into a usable state after something
like that is to quit the program then reload and run it. There is no Undo; there
is no Ctrl+Z.

4.  Doesn't learn from wrong accusations.
If another player makes an accusation that is wrong, then you have to just tell
Dr. Clue to skip that player on that turn (and on subsequent turns, too, since
that player no longer gets turns). So the database does not get updated
and it learns nothing ... but YOU might.

5.  Maximum cards per hand.
Make sure you have enough players for your game of Clue. You can't have more than 15 cards
in your hand!
